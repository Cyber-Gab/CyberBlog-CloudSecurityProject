# CyberBlog-CloudSecurityProject

I built a secure cyber blog!

This repository showcases my completed project for building and securing a cyber blog hosted on the cloud: Azure

Here's a breakdown of what I achieved:

Web Application:

Domain: Created a free Azure domain - gadisecurityresume.azurewebsites.net
IP Address: 20.211.64.16 (Australia East)
Runtime Stack: Used PHP for server-side development
Assets: Organized website assets like CSS styles and images for a user-friendly interface
Security:

Self-Signed Certificate (Analysis): Explored the creation and limitations of self-signed certificates.
SSL/TLS Certificate: Utilized Azure's provided certificate (validity: March 13, 2024 - March 8, 2025).
Certificate Chain: Verified the certificate chain, including Microsoft Azure RSA TLS Issuing CA 07 (intermediate) and DigiCert Global Root G2 (trusted root).
Cloud Security:

WAF Understanding: Compared Azure Web Application Gateway (regional) and Azure Front Door (global) for traffic management and security.
SSL Offloading: Explained offloading SSL decryption to improve web server performance.
WAF Rule Analysis: Explored SQL Injection vulnerabilities and how my website (without user input) is currently not susceptible.
Custom WAF Rule (Hypothetical): Discussed limitations of geo-blocking rules like Canadian users potentially using VPNs.
Screenshots included:

(Add screenshots demonstrating your WAF custom rule here)
Future Charges:

I understand my responsibility for maintaining or disabling the website after the project. I've reviewed Azure cost management guidance.

Yes, I will disable the website after gathering screenshots and completing this document.

Feel free to explore my documentation to learn from my experience!

This project has been a valuable learning experience in cloud security, web development, and cryptography.
